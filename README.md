## Current Version
White Paper v1.0 — published December 2025

Hash Humanity: A Human-Verified Social Network Utilizing Zero-Knowledge Proofs
• rate limiting of event listeners
• Cloud Functions used for sanitizing inputs
• access controls enforce that users may modify only their own data

6. Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Core Framework
• human verification integration
• real-time feed and post architecture
• messaging system
• profile and media layers
• notification system
• discussions module
• basic non-custodial tipping

Phase 2: Reliability, Hardening, and Scale
• optimization of database structure
• rule-based security enhancements
• serverless event auditing
• improved media compression
• rate limiting and abuse-mitigation

Phase 3: Interoperable Cryptographic Identity
• DID and verifiable credential support
• exportable world-ID linked ZK attestations
• external integration endpoints

Phase 4: Expanded Economic Functionality
• multi-chain value routing
• enhanced wallet-layer toolkits
• optional Bitcoin Lightning interoperability
• on-chain attestations of verified human status

Phase 5: Community Tools and Governance
• human-based reputation system
• moderation workflows
• privacy-centric reporting channels
• decentralized governance exploration

7. Tokenomics
Hash Humanity does not maintain or issue a platform token. The project does not conduct token sales, fundraising events, or any activity associated with token speculation. All economic behavior takes place between users directly through their personal wallets.

7.1 Value Transfer Logic
• all transfers are peer-to-peer
• Hash Humanity does not retain custody of assets
• no fees are taken by the platform
• tipping is optional and user-driven

7.2 Rationale for No Token
• reduces regulatory complexity
• eliminates speculative pressure on platform behavior
• avoids supply manipulation
• aligns with the principle of user ownership

8. Conclusion
The increasing presence of automated systems and synthetic identities has created a crisis of authenticity in digital communication. A privacy-preserving, verification-based framework is a plausible method of restoring confidence in online interactions.

Hash Humanity presents a model in which users verify human uniqueness through zero-knowledge proofs while retaining full control over their data and identity. The platform architecture avoids data harvesting, custodial financial mechanisms, and manipulative engagement algorithms. Instead, it emphasizes verifiable authenticity, privacy, and user self-sovereignty.

This white paper provides an overview of the system’s rationale, research basis, structure, and projected development. Further work will focus on interoperability with emerging decentralized identity standards, long-term scalability, and continued refinement of the platform’s security and privacy considerations.
